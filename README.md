# ProductMaker

ProductMaker is a lightweight, experiment‑driven product development
engine. It allows you to quickly spin up product experiments, validate
assumptions, and iterate through the full product development lifecycle
with minimal overhead.

## 🚀 What is ProductMaker?

ProductMaker helps you: - Rapidly test new product ideas\
- Target different customer segments\
- Run lightweight experiments end‑to‑end\
- Validate whether customers want, understand, and are willing to pay
for your product

It is designed for speed, clarity, and ruthless focus on customer value.

## 🔁 Product Development Lifecycle

ProductMaker is built around a repeatable lifecycle:

### 1. **Ideation**

Identify a customer segment and articulate a problem worth solving.
Generate hypotheses about value, pricing, and user behavior.

### 2. **Experiment Design**

Choose the smallest possible test that yields meaningful signal.
Examples: - Landing pages\
- Signup pages\
- Feature mockups\
- Simple workflows\
- Offer tests

Define success metrics (conversion, retention, willingness to pay,
etc.).

### 3. **Build (SLC --- Simple, Lovable, Complete)**

Create the lightest version of the product or experiment that users can
understand and benefit from. SLC means: - **Simple** → Minimal surface
area\
- **Lovable** → Users genuinely enjoy it\
- **Complete** → Solves a full job‑to‑be‑done end‑to‑end

### 4. **Launch & Measure**

Run the experiment in the real world. Track: - Engagement\
- Conversion\
- Feedback\
- Drop‑off points\
- Payment willingness

### 5. **Analyze**

Evaluate experiment results against your hypotheses. Decide whether
to: - **Pivot** → Try a new direction\
- **Persevere** → Improve and continue testing\
- **Kill** → Stop the experiment

### 6. **Iterate**

Incorporate learnings, refine your customer focus, and run the next
experiment. Every loop strengthens understanding and sharpens
product‑market fit.
