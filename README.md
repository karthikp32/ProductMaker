🧪 ProductMaker

Autonomous Product Experiments. Idea → MVP → Users → Revenue.

ProductMaker is a system that allows you to spin up product experiments and run them through the entire product development lifecycle — automatically.

Tell it who to focus on (e.g., “AI startups”, “indie game devs”, “mid-sized ecommerce shops”) and ProductMaker will generate product ideas, build MVPs, launch them, gather metrics, and iterate until it finds something users want and are willing to pay for.

🔄 Product Development Lifecycle

ProductMaker automates the full lifecycle from idea to revenue:

1. Customer & Market Research

ProductMaker identifies and analyzes a target segment:

Pain points

Typical workflows

Willingness to pay

Competitors

Acquisition channels

This becomes the foundation for all experiments.

2. Hypothesis & Ideation

ProductMaker generates multiple product hypotheses, each framed as:

“If we build X for Y users, they will achieve Z outcome.”

Each hypothesis includes:

Problem statement

Proposed solution

Target user persona

Pricing assumption

Success metrics

3. Design (UX / Prototype)

Design agents produce:

Wireframes

UX flows

Landing pages

Clickable prototypes

All optimized for rapid validation.

4. Build (MVP Development)

Engineering agents create functional MVPs with:

Frontend + backend

Deployment pipelines

Basic analytics and instrumentation

Payment integration (sandbox initially)

The goal is fast learning, not full polish.

5. Launch & Experimentation

ProductMaker releases MVPs via:

Targeted marketing campaigns

Cold outreach

A/B tested landing pages

Social media posts / community drops

Each experiment operates under a controlled budget and timeline.

6. Measurement & Analysis

Analytics agents track:

Acquisition metrics (CTR, signups)

Activation and engagement

Retention

Error rates, latency, uptime

Free → paid conversion

Revenue

Qualitative user feedback

All metrics feed into a unified experiment record.

7. Iterate, Scale, or Kill

Based on results:

Successful experiments scale (more features, more marketing).

Promising experiments iterate (improved UX, messaging, pricing).

Underperforming ideas are killed fast, but learnings are retained.

Over time, ProductMaker becomes better at selecting and executing experiments for each customer segment.

🚀 Why ProductMaker

Traditional product development is slow and guess-driven. ProductMaker compresses:

Research

Ideation

Design

Engineering

Marketing

Validation

…into an automated, continuous experimentation engine.

Instead of betting months on a single idea, ProductMaker tests many ideas quickly and invests only in the ones that show real traction.
