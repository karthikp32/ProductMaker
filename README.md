# 🧪 ProductMaker

**Autonomous Product Experiments. Idea → MVP → Users → Revenue.**

ProductMaker is a system designed to spin up *parallel* product experiments and run them through the entire product development lifecycle — automatically.

Tell it who to focus on (e.g., **AI startups**, **indie game devs**, **mid-sized ecommerce shops**) and ProductMaker will:

- Generate product ideas  
- Build MVPs  
- Launch them  
- Measure real user behavior  
- Iterate toward product–market fit  
- Identify which products can make money

Its core purpose: **discover profitable products through rapid, parallel experimentation.**

## 🔄 Product Development Lifecycle

ProductMaker automates the full lifecycle from idea → revenue → iteration:

---

### 1. Customer & Market Research

ProductMaker analyzes the target customer segment to establish a solid foundation for experiments.

Outputs include:

- Pain points  
- Typical workflows and tools  
- Willingness to pay  
- Competitor landscape  
- Likely acquisition channels  

This research seeds all downstream hypothesis generation.

---

### 2. Hypothesis & Ideation

ProductMaker generates multiple product hypotheses, each expressed as:

> **“If we build X for Y users, they will achieve Z outcome.”**

Each hypothesis includes:

- Problem statement  
- Proposed solution  
- Target persona  
- Pricing assumption  
- Success metrics  

These hypotheses drive the initial experiment queue.

---

### 3. Design (UX / Prototype)

Design agents rapidly produce:

- Wireframes  
- UX flows  
- Landing pages  
- Clickable prototypes  

Everything optimized for fast validation — not perfection.

---

### 4. Build (MVP Development)

Engineering agents turn designs into fully functional MVPs:

- Frontend + backend  
- Deployment pipelines  
- Basic analytics + instrumentation  
- Sandbox payment integration  

The goal is **fast learning**, not full production stability.

---

### 5. Launch & Experimentation

ProductMaker autonomously launches MVPs using:

- Targeted marketing campaigns  
- Cold outreach  
- A/B-tested landing pages  
- Social media/community posts  

Each experiment is executed under controlled budget, time, and scope.

---

### 6. Measurement & Analysis

Analytics agents track both product and technical metrics:

**Acquisition & activation**
- CTR, signups, onboarding completion

**Engagement & retention**
- DAU/WAU/MAU  
- Feature usage  
- Drop-off analysis  

**Technical metrics**
- Latency  
- Error rates  
- Uptime  

**Business metrics**
- Free → paid conversion  
- Revenue  
- Qualitative user feedback  

All results are logged into a unified experiment record.

---

### 7. Iterate, Scale, or Kill

Based on experiment performance:

- **Successful experiments scale**  
  (more marketing, more features, deeper integrations)

- **Promising experiments iterate**  
  (improve UX, messaging, pricing, onboarding)

- **Underperforming ideas are shut down quickly**,  
  but all learnings remain in ProductMaker’s knowledge base.

Over time, ProductMaker becomes increasingly effective at selecting, building, and optimizing product experiments for each customer segment.
